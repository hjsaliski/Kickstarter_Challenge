Module 1 Challenge

  1) Overview of Analysis
    For this project we made interpretations of this sheet of data for fundraising goals for different plays and helped answer specific questions based on our findings. Specifically, we looked at two modes, theater outcomes based on the date it was launched and theater outcomes based on their financial goals for each play. For the theater outcomes by launch date we created a pivot tables and organized data by whether or not it was Successful, failed, or canceled for each month of the year. We then created a line graph to better analyze the numbers of plays that were either successful, failed or canceled within each of these months. For the theater outcomes based on goals we organized data by number of successful, failed or canceled plays and their percentage compared to total projects in each categroy respectfully. The number of successful, failed or canceled plays were categorized by the financial goals of each play within certain ranges of funds needed for each play. For clarification, we used excel to count how many plays were either successful, failed or canceled with a financial goal between certain ranges of funds.

  3) Results
    Two conclusions I can make about the Outcomes on Launch date is that during the summer months there were significantly more plays held in general. From April to August we saw most plays being held with a slight drop when fall and winter began. We can also see that in the spring time it seems as though there are more successful plays but looking at percentage of successful plays to total plays during each of the months, each month is fairly consistently reaching about 60-65% successful. 
    For the outcomes based on goals we can see that the most successful plays were mostly in the smaller goal bracket, anything under $5000 had at least a 73% success rate. We can also make the judgement that as the goals of each play increase the chance of success begins to go down and the chance of failure begins to go up. we can see where inbetween 35k and 45k there is a spike in the opposite direction but with such little sample space we cant make the conclusion that this range is totally successful. 
    We could add another aspect to the outcomes by date chart having total number of plays with each section of successful, failed or canceled plays because as it may seem as though successful plays are dropping as the year progresses so is the total number of plays.
